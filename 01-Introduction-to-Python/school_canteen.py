'''In a school canteen, children under the age of 9 are only
given milk porridge for breakfast. Children from 10 to 14 are 
given a sandwich, and children from 15 to 17 are given a burger. 
The canteen master asks the age of the student and gives 
them breakfast
accordingly. It is now time for Sam to
take his breakfast. Use if-else statement 
to determine what the canteen master will offer to him.
